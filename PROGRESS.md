# Octarine Extension Progress - July 6, 2025

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Chrome Extension** - Fully functional for clipping web pages
   - Manifest V3 implementation
   - Readability.js for content extraction
   - Turndown.js for HTML to Markdown conversion
   - Badge notifications instead of popup
   - Extension ID in Chrome: `dhbeogkkhmaegokokbgpplhcbbifinmn` (your specific install)

2. **Swift Menubar App** - Native macOS app with:
   - Pomodoro timer functionality
   - Clippings list with recent items
   - Configurable base folder (defaults to ~/Octarine)
   - Native messaging support
   - Single-instance architecture (new!)
   - Success indicator (checkmark icon for 2 seconds)

3. **Native Messaging** - Working in Chrome
   - Manifest installed at: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.octarine.clipper.json`
   - Single-instance app handles multiple Chrome launches elegantly
   - Uses distributed notifications for inter-process communication

### ❌ Known Issues
1. **Arc Browser** - Native messaging not working
   - "Specified native messaging host not found" error
   - Manifest is installed in multiple Arc directories but Arc doesn't find it
   - Extension ID in Arc: `ccpoplhmbhhjaileoijblcocnhonmmch`

### 🚀 Recent Improvements (Just Completed)
1. Fixed daily note links to include `clippings/` folder prefix
2. Added title trimming to remove extra whitespace
3. Implemented single-instance app architecture:
   - First launch becomes the menubar app
   - Subsequent launches forward messages and exit
   - All clippings go through the same instance
   - UI updates work properly (icon change, list refresh)

### 📁 Project Structure
```
/Users/riclib/src/octarine-extension/
├── chrome-extension/          # Chrome/Arc extension files
├── swift-app/OctarineMenubar/ # Swift menubar app
├── test-*.py/sh              # Testing scripts
├── diagnose-*.sh             # Diagnostic tools
└── README.md                 # Full documentation
```

### 🔧 Key Commands
- Build Swift app: `cd swift-app/OctarineMenubar && swift build -c release`
- Install app: `cp .build/release/OctarineMenubar /Applications/OctarineMenubar.app/Contents/MacOS/`
- Test native messaging: `python3 test-native-messaging.py`
- Diagnose issues: `./diagnose-native-messaging.sh`

### 💡 Next Steps After Reboot
1. **Fix Arc Browser Support**
   - Option A: Continue investigating Arc's native messaging
   - Option B: Switch to HTTP POST API (more reliable, browser-agnostic)

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts in the menubar app
   - Implement search/filter for clippings
   - Add tags support
   - Export functionality
   - Sync with cloud storage

### 🐛 To Debug Arc
If you want to continue with Arc native messaging:
1. Check Arc's developer documentation (if available)
2. Contact Arc support about native messaging
3. Try the HTTP API approach as fallback

### 🎯 HTTP API Alternative (If Needed)
Instead of native messaging, add a simple HTTP server to the Swift app:
- Listen on `localhost:8765`
- Accept POST requests with clipping data
- Use CORS headers for security
- Extension uses `fetch()` instead of `chrome.runtime.sendNativeMessage()`
